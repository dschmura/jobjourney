# JOBJOURNEY README

JobJourney is a place for me to experiment with integrating Rails and Vuejs. It is a tool for job seekers to manage their job search that leverages a kanban style board. 
This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
